# Can-of-Books

**Author**: Jason Wilson / Simon Son  
**Version**: 1.0.5 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->  
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. 
Within this app, you will find a vast amount of books that have had a substantial impact on us.  


## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Cloned template from [back-end template repo](https://github.com/codefellows/can-of-books-backend-template)

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
Name of feature: Can-of-Books  
  
Estimate of time needed to complete: 4hrs  

Start time: 4:20pm est

Actual time needed to complete: 1.5hrs  

## Credit and Collaborations  
Logistical  

  1. What hours will you be available to communicate?  
    - Anytime after 1pm pst./4pm est.  
  2. What platform will you use to communicate?  
    - Phone/Slack/Remo  
  3. How often will you take breaks?  
    - Every 50min. Break = 10min.  
  4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?  
    - We will utilize the available TA's to prevent falling behind. In the event that we do fall behind, we will meet up 1hr before class to play 'catch-up'.  
Cooperative
  1. Make a list of each parsonâ€™s strengths.  
    - Simon: Time management/Openness/Self-Motivated and Self-Reliant  
    - Jason: Affable/Reliable/Self-Motivated and Self-Reliant  
  2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?   
    - Relying on my partner in areas where I may lack. Feeling free to ask questions without ridicule. We both have developed an understanding of  eachothers strengths which will aid in the optimization of a successful project.  
  3. In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?  
    - Simon: Tool efficiency  
    - Jason: Handling Ambiguity  
  4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?  
    - I think as new programmers, we both understand that we are still learning. So where I may have confusion, my partner may have the answer. If not, we are both aware enough to recognize where our weaknesses lie and won't hesitate to ask for help from a TA.  
Conflict Resolution  
  1. What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?   
    - That is not a major concern for our team. We will utilize our affiablity to approach one another.   
  2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?  
    - Politely address my partner and bring it to their awareness. Often times when involved in work, we may unintentionally zone out especially when under pressure. The both of us have agreed to make one another aware of the potential issue.   
  3. How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same    place in understanding and skill level?  
    - Utilizing pair-programming and maintaining an affible relationship between eachother.   
      It is important to know that everyone learns at their own pace and not to ridicule or belittle one another.  


Immense Gratitude to the following individuals on this projects success.
